# About

## Background
I earned my Bachelor of Pharmacy with distinction from Obafemi Awolowo University before transitioning into tech through self-teaching. This unique journey from healthcare to technology gives me a deep understanding of complex systems and user needs.

## Approach
I believe in building products that truly resonate with users. My approach combines analytical thinking from my pharmacy background with design sensibility and technical understanding to create solutions that work.

## Currently
MBA candidate at USC Marshall School of Business, member of Blockchain@USC, exploring the intersection of health tech, product strategy, and innovation.

## Outside of work
You'll find me exploring LA's food scene, writing reflective essays, or playing chess. I believe diverse experiences inform better product decisions.
